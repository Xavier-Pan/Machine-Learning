‣ You need to make a video showing the clustering procedure of your kmeans/kernel kmeans program (excluding spectral clustering)
  You can refer to the following webpage to see what kind of visualization you want to have: 
  http://stanford.edu/class/ee103/visualizations/kmeans/kmeans.html 

‣ In addition to cluster data into 2 clusters, try more clusters and show results. 
  for the initialization of kmeans clustering used in kmeans/kernel kmeans/spectral clustering, 
  you can try different ways and show corresponding results. You will get bonus points if you do so. 

‣ For spectral clustering, you can see if data points within the same cluster 
  do have the same coordinates in the eigenspace of graph Laplacian, discuss in the report to get bonus points. 

‣ Submit a report with showing your code and give detailed explanations 

‣ (2 datasets with points on 2d space, the ground truth cluster assignments will also be provided)
